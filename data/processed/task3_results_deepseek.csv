SYM: Concentrate on each slide detail to WIN the quiz at the end.
SYM: There are several types of learning, categorized based on theories, approaches, and settings. Here’s an overview
SYM: Visual learners understand best through pictures, charts, and diagrams. They prefer shapes and patterns over words or speech. Teachers can help by using tools like graphic organizers to explain ideas clearly.
SYM: Auditory learners learn best by hearing and speaking. They enjoy lectures, group discussions, and talking through ideas. They often figure things out by speaking first, rather than planning what to say.
SYM: Reading & writing learners understand best through words. They enjoy reading and do well with written tasks like stories or reports. They prefer learning through text, such as reading books or writing notes. Teachers can help by asking them to explain diagrams or charts in writing, which they can review later to remember the information.
SYM: Kinesthetic learners learn best by doing. They like hands-on activities, real-life examples, and practicing skills through physical actions. Teachers can help by giving them practical tasks, like recreating experiments or working through examples to understand new ideas.

TRAINEE: Thank you, Alex! How can I help you today?
SYM: We just ordered a bed and a mattress. It was actually delivered last week. Mattress was fine, there's just something about the bed frame. We're kind of not - liking the color. I think we still have the return period so we would like to take advantage of it and we will buy something else.

SYM: However, you can’t get the sale if you don’t ask! That’s the importance of closing.

SYM: To do one today and the one in November?
TRAINEE: Yes. Because it takes two to three months before it will be reflected on the account or it will be given to the child. Is it only for your child in Peru or are we going to set up for the one that is from Rwanda, for a month?

Startek_Telco_Visual_BEG_Demo ,"TRAINEE: Thank you for calling Xfinity Mobile, we appreciate your business. This is (YOUR NAME). May I have your name please?
SYM: My name is Danerra Lamburth.
TRAINEE: What a beautiful name! Is it okay if I call you by your first name?
SYM: Sure, that's fine.
TRAINEE: Awesome! How are you doing today, Danerra?
SYM: I'm doing fine, thank you. How about yourself?
TRAINEE: I'm glad to hear that. I'm doing great as well. Thank you for asking. Tell me, how may I help you today?
SYM: I received the SIM card the other day, and as of today, it is still not activated.
TRAINEE: Thank you for clarifying that for me! I'd be happy to assist you with activating your new SIM card. To begin the process, I need to access your account first. I'll be asking you a few questions for security purposes; would that be fine?
SYM: Sure!
TRAINEE: Great! Can you please provide me with your billing address on file?
SYM: 6000 Hollister St, Apartment 1 8 1 6, Houston, Texas 7 7 0 4 0.
TRAINEE: How about the last four digits of the credit or debit card on file?
SYM: 4 9 8 0
TRAINEE: Thank you, Danerra, for providing all the necessary information to access your account. Your cooperation is appreciated. I was able to pull up your account, and I can see that you have two iPhone devices. May I know the mobile number of the device on which you would like to activate the new SIM card?
SYM: (560) 346-9876
TRAINEE: To ensure that I got the correct number, which is (560) 346-9876, is that correct?
SYM: Yes, that's correct.
TRAINEE: Nice! How about the ICCID number of the new SIM card?
SYM: Where can I find that?
TRAINEE: The ICCID for your Xfinity Mobile SIM card can typically be found printed on the SIM card itself or on the SIM card packaging. It is a unique 20-digit number that identifies your SIM card. If you're unable to locate the ICCID on the SIM card or packaging, you can find it in the settings of your phone once it's inserted. On your iPhone, go to Settings > General > About. The entry titled ICCID is your SIM card number.
SYM: I found it! The number is too small on the card. That is 8 9 1 4 8 0 0 0 0 0 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0.
TRAINEE: To confirm, it is 89148000009876543210, am I right?
SYM: Yes.
TRAINEE: Thank you for confirming it. Let me go ahead and update the new SIM card on your phone. This may take a few minutes to complete the process, and I'll be asking you to reset the network settings of your phone afterwards.
SYM: Sure. Take your time.
TRAINEE: Okay, here's what I found out, Danerra. Your SIM card is not activated because of the pending order on the account. And this needs to be completed before your SIM card can be activated.
SYM: It's been three days; I am confused as to why my phone is still not working, and is this the only reason why?
TRAINEE: So please give me a moment while I am working on it. I will let you know once the pending order is completed and to activate the SIM card.
SYM: Sure, take your time.
TRAINEE: All right, Danerra. I was able to activate and update your new SIM card. Kindly insert the new SIM card and reset the network settings on your phone. Before that, I would like to set your expectation that any saved Wi-Fi networks and passwords will be removed and all paired devices will be unpaired. So, after you reset the network settings, please set up your phone so everything will be connected again. Just go to Settings > General > Reset. Then select ""Reset Network Settings"" and confirm your choice when prompted. After the reset, your phone will restart. Please test the call functionality afterwards.
SYM: I already inserted the SIM card and reset the network settings. My phone is restarting now.
TRAINEE: Once your phone is back on, please check the network connectivity and let me know if everything is working as expected.
SYM: Sure, I will.
TRAINEE: While your phone is restarting, I'd like to express my gratitude for being a valued [Silver, Gold, Platinum, or Premium] customer with Xfinity Rewards. As a loyal customer, you have access to exciting rewards and exclusive benefits. The longer you stay with us, the more rewards you can enjoy.

TRAINEE: Nice to meet you John, how are you today?
SYM: Fine and you?
TRAINEE: I'm fine as well, thanks for asking. Let me know John, how can I assist you today?
SYM: Yes, I purchased a car seat stroller combo for my daughter-in-law, and it's not the right one, and I misplaced the receipt.
SYM: I went to the store and they told me to call you guys that you can help me locate it because I paid for cash with it.
TRAINEE: Thanks John, and do you know the store ZIP code or the store number you made the purchase on?
SYM: Yes, the store number is 1 5 8 4.
TRAINEE: Just to confirm I have the right store, is this the Super Center on Rainbow 3615?
SYM: Correct, that is the one.
TRAINEE: Thanks John, and could you please tell me if you remember the day of the purchase?
SYM: I do know that I purchased it in February. I'm not sure the exact date, but I believe it was during the first two weeks in February, if I'm not mistaken.
TRAINEE: Okay, thank you John. So, you told me it was with cash, do you remember how much was the total amount of the receipt?
SYM: The car seat stroller combo was around $199. So, I want to say I know I didn't spend no more than 350 so maybe search 250 to 350 dollars.
TRAINEE: Okay, so let me search for the receipt information right now based on the description provided. Allow a moment.
TRAINEE: I can see I found one that matches your description. Was the item you are lookng for the ""Sonar Switch 6 in 1 Modular Stroller Travel Sytems""?

SymTrain - Overview,"SYM: Welcome to SymTrain! I’m Coach Sym and I’m here to help you get familiar with using the DSC training resource, SymTrain.
SYM: Let’s start by reviewing some tips for how to navigate throughout a Sym.
SYM: When you see a box outlined in blue, that is something in the sym you need to click in order to continue.
SYM: A green box indicates a text field. You will need to type a response in the box. Use your mouse to click inside the box, type the required text, then press enter on your keyboard while still in the text box to submit your response.
SYM: Let’s practice! Type your favorite color in the box that appears.
SYM: Thanks for sharing!
SYM: The final interaction portion you will encounter in syms is speaking.
SYM: If a sym requires a verbal response, a microphone will appear. Say your answer out loud, then click the next button to continue.
SYM: Let’s practice! When the microphone icon appears, read the dialogue that appears in the bottom of your screen, then click next.
TRAINEE: Hello, my name is (your first name).
SYM: Great job!
SYM: Let’s continue with how to navigate SymTrain.
SYM: Your SymTrain Home page will show your Overall Stats on the syms you have completed.
SYM: You are also able to make Accessibility Adjustments.
SYM: Here are some of the options available. After this sym, feel free to check out how the different settings work and toggle on any settings that are beneficial to you.
SYM: SymTrain also has a built in Support feature if you need help at any time.
SYM: You have the option to message SymTrain for support, provide feedback, or use the SymTrain AI_Help for self-troubleshooting.
SYM: Since you are taking this sym, you have obviously learned how to launch a sym – way to go!
SYM: However, you might not have realized there is more than one way to launch a sym.
SYM: The first is click the play icon next to any of the syms shown on your Home page.
SYM: The second is from your My Exercises tab, let’s head there now.
SYM: Here is where you will find all syms that have been assigned to you as well as your progress.
SYM: As you continue your journey in the DSC, you may have more than 10 rows of assignments and will need to expand your rows per page or view the other pages to find assignments.
SYM: If you see a stacked icon, that indicates that is a sym module, which means it contains more than one sym. Click the icon to expand and see the included syms.
SYM: On the right, you can see what syms you have already completed in that module.
SYM: To launch a sym from your exercises, you can click on the play icon on the left of the sym or module.
SYM: Or you can click on an individual sym from the module list to launch that sym. Let’s practice that.
SYM: As you already saw, you can select if you would like to proceed with completing a Practice or Test version of the sym.
SYM: You can also select a different sym to launch from the module list by clicking the play icon on the sym tile.
SYM: Some syms, like the one you are taking right now, require verbal responses. It is important to make sure the correct microphone setting is selected so SymTrain can hear you and record your response.
SYM: Before starting your first sym of the day, you should check your hardware.
SYM: Using your company provided headset is the best practice to ensure that SymTrain can pick up your voice clearly. To use the headset while in a sym, make sure it is plugged into your laptop and not your phone.
SYM: While you can select your laptop’s built in microphone as an option, depending on your desk setup that microphone might be too far away to pick up your voice clearly.
SYM: Let’s practice what this would look like.
SYM: For the purposes of this sym, we will give you a prompt to speak into the microphone.
SYM: When you a ready, click Start Recording for a prompt to appear at the bottom of the screen.
SYM: Say the prompt out loud, then click the Next icon that appears to continue.
TRAINEE: Mic check. Test one, two, three.
SYM: Great job! After recording, there will be a playback button that will allow you to hear how you sound to ensure quality recording throughout any sym that day.
SYM: That was just a simulated practice. Be sure to check this feature out for real before your next sym.
SYM: The final area to explore is the Playback. We will review that next sym.
SYM: What did we learn today? Take a moment to review some of the key learnings from this sym.
SYM: Click the lightbulb when you are ready to continue.
SYM: Fantastic job completing your first sym! Let’s stay on track and head over to the next one where we learn how to view your sym playback.",The customer is participating in a training session to learn how to use the SymTrain platform and its features.,"['Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the sym, including clicking blue boxes, typing in green text fields, and using the microphone for verbal responses.', 'Access the SymTrain Home page to view overall stats and make accessibility adjustments as needed.', 'Launch syms from the Home page or My Exercises tab, and select Practice or Test versions as required.', 'Ensure proper hardware setup by using a company-provided headset plugged into the laptop and checking microphone settings before starting a sym.', 'Utilize the Support feature for help, feedback, or self-troubleshooting with SymTrain AI_Help.']"
SymTrain - Sym Playback,"SYM: Welcome back! Congratulations on completing your first sym a moment ago. Now let’s see how you did.
SYM: Before we get started, I want to draw your attention to the sym time length on the opening screen of each sym.
SYM: This lets you know on average how long it should take to complete the sym.
SYM: Take a moment to look for the “Time Elapsed” located at the top of this sym.
SYM: As you work through syms, be sure to keep an eye on your pace so you can finish within the allotted time for the assignment.
SYM: Let’s proceed full steam ahead!
SYM: Reminder, here are some best practices for navigating throughout a sym. Click the arrow when you are ready to continue.
SYM: After completing a sym, you will be directed to a screen that looks like this.
SYM: From here you can already see your Completion Time, Keyword Score, and Click Score.
SYM: To view more details on your sym score, click View Playback.
SYM: This playback view provides more insight on your performance.
SYM: You can see if you completed the sym in Practice or Test Mode, the day and time completed, and you can even click re-attempt and do it again from here.
SYM: Here is that completion time again.
SYM: Completion time is important because if it is taking you longer to navigate the conversation and screens, it can be an indication that you just need to practice the sym more to learn the process better.
SYM: Let’s break down the other stats on the screen, starting with Keyword Score.
SYM: Keywords are structure words in the conversation that are good word choices or can even be compliance words that must be said. If the sym has no agent lines, you will not have a keyword score.
SYM: The DSC is not a scripted environment. The key words chosen throughout the syms will be ones that everyone should say.
SYM: For example, everyone should state “Mutual of Omaha” in your call introduction.
SYM: The first number is your keyword score, and the second is the possible score.
SYM: In that last sym, I got 3 out of 4 keywords correct.
SYM: To see which one I missed, I can scroll down to find it in the playback.
SYM: Words highlighted green indicate you got the keyword correct, while red indicates it was missed.
SYM: Here I can see that I missed the first word, hello.
SYM: You can click the Trainee Response to jump to that part of the recording, then click Play to listen.
SYM: After listening to my playback, I could here that I said hello, but the microphone didn’t start picking up right away so the greeting was cut off.
SYM: Technology is not perfect. There could also be times where it thought you said a different word. For example, application and occupation can sound similar to a computer.
SYM: That is why the training team and your supervisors review playback on lower scoring syms.
SYM: This allows them to see if it was a system error or a coaching opportunity.
SYM: Scroll back to the top to look at the rest of the sym score.
SYM: Let’s review Click Score next.
SYM: Click Score is scoring where on the visual components of the sym you navigated and clicked through during the process. Click score will only be in visual syms.
SYM: The first number is your click score, and the second is the possible score.
SYM: In that last sym, I got 19 out of 19 clicks correct. Way to go me! That is a good indicator that I understand the process in the sym.
SYM: Confidence, Concentration and Energy are your sentiment scores.
SYM: These scores are calculated by the level of intent you deliver the script line in the areas of confidence, concentration and energy.
SYM: These are not calculated on your voice or tone, but on how confident your level of intent is, your focus or concentration level, and your pace or energy level.
SYM: The sentiment score is calculated for the entire sym, not one part or another.
SYM: My Energy score was Medium. I can click Insights to view more.
SYM: This is where I can find insight on how to improve that score if I were to take it again, or helpful advice for future syms.
SYM: Next let’s look at the Sym Accuracy Score.
SYM: This measures how well your response matched the intent of what the customer was asking in the customer script line.
SYM: SymTrain is still working on improvements to the Sym Accuracy score, and this is being monitored by the training team at the moment.
SYM: The final stat to look at is the Sym Score.
SYM: This will equal a combined score of the different scoring options for that sym. If this is a beginner sym your score should be in the 80% range.
SYM: Again, technology is not perfect. That is why the training team and supervisors will take a look at those lower scores to see if it was a system error or a coaching opportunity for improvement.
SYM: Now that we’ve reviewed how to look at detailed playback after completing a sym, let’s head to the Playback page.
SYM: The Playback page provides an overview of your sym performance for all your completed syms.
SYM: To view the detailed playback for any sym, simply click the Actions icon.
SYM: This concludes the simulation.
SYM: What did we learn today? Take a moment to review some of the key learnings from this sym.
SYM: Click the lightbulb when you are ready to continue.

TRAINEE STARTS HERE_ How did you do_ View your Playback!  ,"SYM: Congratulations on running your first sym. Now lets see how you did. From here you can already see your Completion Time, Keyword and Click score.
SYM: Keywords are structure words in the the conversation that are good word choices or can even be compliance words that must be said. If the sym has no agent lines you will not have a keyword score. Click score is scoring where on the visual components of the sym you navigated and clicked through during the process. Click score will only be in visual syms.
SYM: All of the playbacks for every sym you execute will always be in Playback on the left side of the screen, last tab, with the headphone icon.
SYM: For now, Click the Green View Playback button to see more detail on how you did.
SYM: Starting at the top left, you can see every attempt you have completed of this sym, and the playback for each. This allows you to see how you are improving with each attempt.
SYM: You can also see if you completed it in Practice or Test Mode, the day and time completed, and you can even click re-attempt and do it again.
SYM: Next you will see your Sym Accuracy Score. This measures how well your response matched the intent of what the customer was asking in the customer script line. If this is a beginner sym your score should be in the 90% range, because you would have said the script line pretty close to word for word, to learn the intent. In Intermediate and Advanced Syms, when you are formulating your own words, this score might go down, but you want to aim for the 80-90% range, so that your intent is matching the need of the customer as closely as possible. If your sym has no agent lines you will not have a sym accuracy score.
SYM: Completion time is important because if it is taking you longer to navigate the conversation and screens, it can be an indication that you just need to practice the beginner sym more to learn the process better. It won't take long before you will know exactly what to do. Keep practicing.
SYM: The first number in the keyword score is your score, and the second is the possible score. Keywords are structure words that are good word choices you will want to say, or they can even be compliance words you must say. Keywords guide you to the best and fastest way to customer resolution and satisfaction.
SYM: The first number in the click score is your score, and the second is the possible score. Click scores are the places on the screens where you clicked, and it scored you if you clicked in the correct place.
SYM: The Sym Score will equal a combined score of the different scoring options. If a sym has all three, Sym Accuracy, Keyword and Click Score, the sym score will be total of all, as one sym score. If a sym has two or only one of these scoring options, the sym score will equal the total of only the scoring options used in that sym.
SYM: Text Field Keyword score will appear if the sym was created with keywords in the Text Fields that can be put into visual syms. A best practice is to always enter text into those fields exactly as directed because you never know if that text will be a keyword or not until you finish.
SYM: Confidence, Concentration and Energy are your sentiment scores. These scores are calculated by the level of intent you deliver the script line in the areas of confidence, concentration and energy. These are not calculated on your voice or tone, but on how confident your level of intent is, how your focus or concentration level and how your pace or energy level of intent is. The sentiment score is calculated for the entire sym, not one part or another.
SYM: The measurement for sentiment scores will be High, Medium or Low, and you can click the insights to learn more about what you did well, and what you can do to improve.
SYM: As a reminder you will not receive a sentiment score in your practice attempts, only in your test attempts, and if your sym has no agent lines, you will not have a sentiment score.
SYM: The playback also allows you to listen to a recording of you executing the sym. You can click a script line below and the recording will skip to that part of the recording if you wanted to only listen to a certain part.
SYM: If you see a dot in the recording like this, this is the Text Field Key Word Score we just talked about. This will show you if you got that word or if you missed it. As you can see I missed it because it is red, and it gave me the correct response.
SYM: The bottom part of the playback page is the actual script. The highlighted words are the keywords. If they are green I got them. If they are red I missed them. You will also notice the KS and SA and then a number score, like 3/4 and a percent, such as 86%. These are your Keyword Scores and Sym Accuracy scores by script line. The first number in the keyword score is your score and the second is the possible score. The Sym Accuracy score tells you how you did in this line with intent compared to the customer script line you were responding to.
SYM: This gives you the ability to see exactly in the sym where you can improve on keywords and sym accuracy. The total Sym Accuracy and Keyword scores at the top are a total of these by script line totals.
SYM: And finally you will always see the scripted line with the keywords you said or did not say vs what you said in response. The default is to show both, but you can toggle that off if you want to just see the scripted line and the keywords you said or did not say.
SYM: Great Job! This concludes your simulation.",The customer is seeking guidance on understanding and improving their performance in a simulation exercise.,"['Review the playback to analyze completion time, keyword, and click scores.', 'Check sym accuracy scores to assess intent matching with customer script lines.', 'Examine sentiment scores for confidence, concentration, and energy levels.', 'Identify missed keywords and sym accuracy issues in the script lines for targeted improvement.', 'Practice repeatedly to enhance navigation, keyword usage, and intent delivery.']"
UCSL eApp – State Specifics,"SYM: In this sym, we will review how the UCSL application varies based on state.
SYM: Reminder that we can not C O P whole life applications for Connecticut or Montana.
SYM: New York has its own application for our Guaranteed Whole Life policy. We’ll go into detail on New York later.
SYM: The states in red on the map have some different verbatim messages that will appear in the e App.
SYM: Remember that these boxes are verbatim statements.
SYM: You should not try to memorize these, as they may change for each state.
SYM: Always be sure to read what's on your screen word for word.
SYM: One such example is with California, the final application verbatim has an additional paragraph regarding fraud.
SYM: This allows us to be compliant with California law. The fraud statement is also provided in the policy documents.
SYM: Again, this is why you should not memorize verbatims. Simply follow the application.
SYM: Another California law requires we obtain an email address from our California elders (which is age 65 or older) so we can send them pertinent disclosures before the application is completed.
SYM: To comply with the California law, there is a verbatim early in the application regarding consent to electronic delivery and e-signature.
SYM: The verbatim and email address field is mandatory, and the e-app will prevent you from continuing the application if you do not enter in a valid customer email address.
SYM: Once you have entered the email address in the box you must press the Send button. If you don’t press this button, the e-app will prevent you from continuing the application.
SYM: If the email fails to send, the Send button will turn red and will say Fail.
SYM: The e-app will prevent you from moving forward until an email has successfully been sent.
SYM: If the email successfully sends, the Send button will turn green and will say Sent.
SYM: Once you have received the green Sent message, you need to ask the customer to verbally confirm they received the email.
SYM: This is what the email that the customer receives looks like.
SYM: Here’s another question that will only appear during the application in certain states.
SYM: These states have state special questions and verbiage that is required to be read about accessing PDF files via the internet and providing their consent to receive electronic documents.
SYM: The state requires we review this electronic consent.
SYM: We're asking if they can access the internet in any shape or form.
SYM: If they say no, you can clarify by asking if they have access to the internet (smart phone, library, etc.).
SYM: If they still answer No, you will need to explain to the applicant that if they are not able to access the internet, or do not provide their consent, you will not be able to take their application over the phone and it will need to be mailed to them. This may delay the processing time and the effective date of their policy.
SYM: Let’s practice a state specific scenario! Click the arrow when you are ready to begin.
TRAINEE: Have you received an application packet?
SYM: No.
TRAINEE: Are you able to open, view and save P D F files via the internet?
SYM: No.
TRAINEE: Do you have access to the internet by using a smart phone or going to the library?
SYM: Oh, yes. I can do that.
TRAINEE: I am required to obtain your consent for the delivery of electronic documents to you whether through the internet, email, web, text, instant message, digital media or the like. Your consent applies to all documents Mutual of Omaha may be required to deliver to you in writing. Any document provided to you electronically may be provided in paper upon your request. You may withdraw your consent at any time. If you withdraw your consent, I will not be able to complete your application over the phone and I will need to mail you a paper application. You may withdraw your consent, update your contact information or obtain a paper copy of any document for no charge, by contacting (800) 775-6000. You will need access to a computer or other device which provides internet access or email, as well as the ability to open, view and save a PDF, text or html file.

SYM: Yes, I understand I can't make any changes to my ticket, but I'm booked at 1:00 o'clock PM and I need to leave on the 5:50 PM flight instead What am I on? Flight instead What are my options?
TRAINEE: That's a good question, let's check.
TRAINEE: Since there is a $200 change fee plus the difference in fare let me look what booking a new flight from Chicago O'Hare to Atlanta as an option for you.
SYM: OK, great if it's less than $200, that may be a great idea
TRAINEE: Wow, Mrs. McCann I found the flight you are looking for at 5:50pm from Chicago O'Hare to Atlanta for $106 plus a $25 non-refundable booking fee. Would you like me to book that for you?
